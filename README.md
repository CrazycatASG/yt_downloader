### A simple GUI wrapper around yt_dlp for downloading Youtube videos

there is a check regarding whether it is a youtube video to prevent inconvinence for the user in case they try to use the full yt_dlp functionality
this was also really meant as an experiment that could help my mum and dad so there's not much effort lol

as i don't really care too much for this program, it is released into the public domain, or CC0, at your choice.
